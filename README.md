# Seinfeld Quotes API

It's an API about nothing! Just kidding... 

I built an RESTful API with CRUD functionality using data from https://github.com/wdifruscio/seinfeld-api/blob/master/seinfeld.js. You could use this API to create a trivia game, a random quote generator, or a wiki.

Each **object** contains the following:
- Quote
- Author of quote
- Season
- Episode

**Technologies used:**
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB

## Routes

The landing page is located at /api. Quotes data can be found at /api/quotes.

## Installation

Hopefully using this API won't make you feel like this...
