# Seinfeld Quotes API

It's an API about nothing! Just kidding... 

I built an RESTful API with CRUD functionality using data from https://github.com/wdifruscio/seinfeld-api/blob/master/seinfeld.js. 

Each **document** contains the following:
- Quote
- Author of quote
- Season
- Episode

**Technologies used:**
- JavaScript
- Express
- Mongoose
- MongoDB

## Routes

## Installation
